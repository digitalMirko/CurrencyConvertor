# CurrencyConvertor
App created in Android Studio 2.1.2 and tested on a Nexus 5 Android Emulator then on a Motorola Moto X Developer Edition Android phone.

This app converts U.S. Dollars(USD) to British Pounds (GBP) with the current exchange rate (0.809185 to 1 U.S. Dollar) 
as of December 21, 2016.

The app launches and has a simple screen showing a title("This App Converts U.S. Dollars to British Pounds", 
Number Text Field Widget (hint:"U.S. Dollar amount), a Button labeled 'Convert' and a image of some British currency.

When the user clicks the Number Text Field Widget. A decimal keypad pops up. Then when the user starts typing the hint text 
("U.S. Dollar amount") disappears and the numbers they typed in appear in the Text Field. 

When they are done entering the numbers the user can simply clock the green round done button with a check mark in it to dismiss the keypad 
or just leave it there and click the "CONVERT" Button to display the Toast box that pops up to give them their answer in British Pounds.

Example: GBP 45.05 (note: The British Pounds answer is rounded off to two places when displayed).

Note: If the user clicks the done button on the keypad when they are done entering in the U.S. Dollar around they will 
be brought back to the British currency image in the background with Toast box appearing over it.
